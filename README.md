# Digital Disparities: A Comparative Web Measurement Study

This repository contains the dataset, tools, and analysis for our research paper **"Digital Disparities: A Comparative Web Measurement Study Across Economic Boundaries"**, presented at WWW'25. The study explores differences in web development practices across developed and developing countries, focusing on web size, complexity, security, privacy, technology adoption, and performance optimization.

## üìÑ **Abstract**
While internet usage continues to grow globally, significant disparities persist in how websites are developed and optimized across developed and developing nations. This study presents a comprehensive web measurement analysis of 200,000 popular webpages from 20 countries, providing insights into how the web experience varies due to economic contexts. Key findings include differences in web performance, security practices, technology adoption, and optimization.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### **Website List**
The `website_list/` folder includes the lists of all 200,000 websites analyzed in this study, with one file per country. Each file contains the top 10,000 websites for that specific country based on Google CrUX and IMF classifications.

### **Usage**
- **Exploration:**
  Use the country-specific files in `website_list/` to explore the top websites analyzed in this study.
- **Data Access:**

## üìä **Results**
Key findings from the analysis include:
1. **Web Performance:** Websites in developing countries are smaller and simpler but often poorly optimized.
2. **Security:** HTTPS adoption is lower in developing regions (88% vs. 95% in developed countries).
3. **Technology:** Developing countries show promising adoption rates for modern protocols like HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.
4. **Privacy:** Websites in developed nations use more trackers and cookies despite stricter regulations.
